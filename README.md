A tic-tac-toe game written in Java. 
Players the game in PvC and PvP modes via IDE’s console, and/or CLI, and/or a client app. 
The game helps Java developers to release stress by allowing them to play a simple game, 
within the developer’s own workspace, against the program itself or against other player, 
to take a brake from work, engage with fellow team mates and have fun at the same time without ever leaving you workspace at all. 
The game’s title will be Jic-Jac-Joe.

# Running the Jic Jac joe:

### IMPORTANT NOTES  

The project was implemented in IntelliJ IDEA and has 1 dependency, 
which is the Java annotations library is has been included in the repository 
and zipped folder in the assignment submission field.  

Also, JUnit lib has been already integrated to the Jic Jac Joe's project for module 2, 
but do not have any test implementations for module 1. 

The project has CI/CD integration already via Travis-CI using Apache-Ant build tool, this is for 
running and validating the project's test with JUnit in every commit pushed to the repository. 

### Running

Basically, the project should run as it is, without any additional configuration, in the CLI or IDE's console.  

To run the game in the CLI (a Unix Bash shell), navigate to the working directory and type this command in your unix terminal:  
`java -cp <LOCAL WORKING DIRECTORY>/out/production/JicJacJoe edu.bu.met.CS622.JicJacJoe.Main`

Don't forget to add your local path to the command.
