A tic-tac-toe game written in Java. 
Players the game in PvC and PvP modes via IDE’s console, and/or CLI, and/or a client app. 
The game helps Java developers to release stress by allowing them to play a simple game, 
within the developer’s own workspace, against the program itself or against other player, 
to take a brake from work, engage with fellow team mates and have fun at the same time without ever leaving you workspace at all. 
The game’s title will be Jic-Jac-Joe.
